## Transcriber's notes

This document has been transcribed by [Mark Trapp](https://marktrapp.com) and [Jesse McGrew](https://bitbucket.org/jmcgrew) from a [PDF maintained by the Defense Technical Information Center](http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA070930). It attempts to be as faithful to the original as possible deviating only to adopt modern formatting techniques, account for limitations of Markdown and the web, and add links where appropriate.

To this end, the original language has been maintained as much as humanly possible. When I've noticed an error in the original text, I've indicated it with *[sic]*. If the text requires clarification, my notes will be marked clearly like so:

!!! note "Transcriber's note"
    This is a transcriber's note.

If you do notice an error in this current version, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/itafroma/mdl-docs/issues) or [submit a pull request](https://github.com/itafroma/mdl-docs/pulls).

## Copyright

The original manual is likely copyright Â© 1979 Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It was written by S. W. Galley and Greg Pfister, but all indications point to it being work-for-hire as part of MIT's contract with DARPA.

As disseminated to the United States Department of Defense, it has the [distribution statement "A"](http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/submit/distribution_statements.html), meaning that it is approved for public release and distribution is unlimited. This classification is the basis under which a good-faith effort to preserve an otherwise-public document has been made.
