# Appendix 2. Predefined Subroutines

The following is a very brief description of all the primitives 
(F/SUBRs) currently available in MDL. These descriptions are in no 
way to be considered a definition of the effects or values produced 
by the primitives. They just try to be as complete and as accurate as 
is possible in a single-statement description. However, because of 
the complexity of most primitives, many important assumptions and 
restrictions have been omitted. Even though all primitives return a 
value, some descriptions mention only the side effects produced by a 
primitive, because these primitives are most often used for this 
effect rather than the value.

A description is given in this format:

*name* (*arguments*)  
*decl*  
English description

This format is intended to look like a `FUNCTION` definition, 
omitting the call to `DEFINE` and all internal variable and code. The 
*name* is just the ATOM that is used to refer to the primitive. The 
names of the *arguments* are intended to be mnemonic or suggestive of 
their meanings. The *decl* is a `FUNCTION`-style `DECL` (chapter 14) 
for the primitive. In some cases the `DECL` may look unusual, because 
it is intended to convey information to a person about the uses of 
arguments, not to convey information to the MDL interpreter or 
compiler. For example, `<OR FALSE ANY>` is functionally equivalent to 
`ANY`, but it indicates that only the "truth" of the argument is 
significant. Indeed, the `[OPT ...]` construction is often used 
illegally, with other elements following it: be warned that MDL would 
not accept it. An argument is included in the same `LIST` with 
`VALUE` (the value of the primitive) only if the argument is actually 
returned by the primitive as a value. In other words, `#DECL ((VALUE 
ARG) ...)` implies `<==? .VALUE .ARG>`.
